# Elevating assembly to C

How functions get converted here, and the compiler behaviours that stop them.

## The loop

1. **Pick by shape, not size.** `tools/elevation_candidates.py` ranks the
   remaining hand-written assembly. Small is *not* the same as tractable -- the
   first batch attempted here took the five smallest flag accessors in
   `rom_79338_c_a.s` and matched none of them, because that family is
   scheduling-sensitive and this tree already has its neighbour `ToggleFlag` in
   `fakematch.txt` behind inline-asm barriers.

   The ranker skips ARM functions outright. The ROM is built `-mthumb`, so an
   `.arm_func_start` body cannot have come from C at all.

2. **Read the function.** `tools/showfunc.py <name>` prints it wherever it
   lives, with its annotation, so a 30-instruction target does not require
   opening a 4,000-line file.

3. **Write the C and screen it.** `tools/tryc.py` compiles a candidate and
   diffs the instruction stream against the ROM's assembly:

       docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work goldensun-build \
           python3 tools/tryc.py scratch/candidate.c --ref asm/<...>.s

   `--ref` is what makes it possible to prove a function *before* wiring it
   into the build. Most targets sit inside a multi-function `.s` that has to be
   split and relinked first, and that is a lot of churn to spend on a candidate
   that then fails.

4. **Split, if needed.** A `.o` comes from one source file, so a function
   inside a multi-function `.s` needs `tools/split_s.py <file.s> <FuncName>`,
   which produces the `_a`/`_b`/`_c` shape the tree already uses and rewrites
   the linker script.

   **Verify `make compare` is green after the split and before writing any C.**
   The split is byte-neutral by construction, so if it is not green, the layout
   is wrong -- and a layout mistake looks exactly like a bad decompilation if
   both land at once.

5. **Build.** `tools/tryc.py` is a screen, not a verdict. `make compare` is the
   only authority.

## Working discipline

Three rules learned by breaking them.

**The build result must gate the commit, not run beside it.** Running
`make` and then `git commit` as separate steps commits whatever happened,
including a broken link. Chain them, or check the exit code:

    docker run ... sh -c 'make AGBCC_DIR=/opt/agbcc -j8 && make AGBCC_DIR=/opt/agbcc compare' \
        && git commit ...

**Write commit messages through a quoted heredoc**, never through
`python3 -c "..."` or any double-quoted shell string. Backticks and `$` in a
double-quoted string are substituted by the shell, which silently eats
fragments of the message -- it has mangled three commits here:

    cat > /tmp/m.txt <<'MSGEOF'
    ...message...
    MSGEOF
    git commit -F /tmp/m.txt

**`git checkout` is denied by this project's permission rules** (the pattern
that blocks branch switching also matches file restores). Use `git restore`.

## What the screen has to normalise

Three spellings differ between gcc's output and the ROM's disassembly without
any difference in machine code. Before these were folded, every function
carrying a constant reported a total mismatch from instruction zero:

| | gcc | disassembly |
|---|---|---|
| destructive Thumb ops | `lsl r2, r2, #2` | `lsl r2, #2` |
| immediates | `#145` | `#0x91` |
| literal pools | `ldr r3, .L14` + `.word` | `ldr r3, =value` |

A fourth was a bug rather than a spelling: label numbering has to be
**per function**, not per file. Shared across a file, a single-function
candidate compared against a multi-function reference gets different numbers
for identical control flow. `ActorCmd_GotoIfZ` read as a mismatch for three
rounds while being byte-exact.

## Codegen facts that decided matches

Established by getting specific functions to match, and reusable:

- **A `u16` field assigned to a `u16` local** loads with `ldrsh` plus a
  redundant zero-extend. Assigned to an **`s32` local** it loads with the
  `ldrh` the ROM uses. The shift is arithmetic either way, because the value
  promotes to `int`.
- **Struct indexing and pointer arithmetic are not interchangeable.**
  `base[i].field` and `*(u32 *)(base + (i << 3) + off)` compute the same
  address but allocate the base pointer and the scaled index to opposite
  registers.
- **gcc pops its return address into r1 instead of r0 when the return type is
  non-void**, whether or not anything is returned. `Func_80b7e7c` only matches
  declared `s32` with no `return` statement.
- **Reading a field twice in the source** is what produces the ROM's redundant
  copy before a compare. Caching it in a local removes the copy.
- **The `if` body becomes the fall-through path.** Where the ROM branches away
  from the code that follows the test, that code was the `if` body in the
  original -- so `ActorCmd_GotoIfNZ` and `ActorCmd_GotoIfZ` are both written
  with the jump as the body and the cursor step as the `else`, rather than one
  being the negation of the other.
- **Taking a pointer to a field and dereferencing it** costs a register and can
  force an extra callee-save push. Access the field through the struct pointer
  each time.

## Technique: stopping a constant fold with symbol addresses

Where the ROM computes a constant AT RUNTIME:

    ldr r3, =0xc9b / ldr r1, =0xcc6 / sub r1, r3

no C written with literals reproduces it — `0xcc6 - 0xc9b` folds to one
immediate and a pool word vanishes. The operands were the **addresses of
absolute symbols** in the original, and gcc cannot fold the difference between
two link-time addresses:

    extern int _MSG_c9b;
    extern int _MSG_cc6;
    f(first, (int)&_MSG_cc6 - (int)&_MSG_c9b);

Define the ids in `message.sym`, a linker fragment whose definitions emit no
bytes. This unlocked the whole seven-function `OvlFunc_974` family.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **Which ids must be symbols is not arbitrary.** The subtraction's operands
  must be, or the fold returns. Every other argument stays a plain literal
  *unless* the ROM reuses one register for both that argument and a side of
  the subtraction — then it must be a symbol too. Either mistake costs an
  instruction.
- **`message.sym` is not a tracked dependency of `stage1.o`.** After adding
  symbols, delete `stage1.o` by hand or the overlays will not see them and the
  link fails with an undefined reference.

`tools/find_runtime_constants.py` lists every function in the corpus with this
signature and says which symbols each would need.

## Blockers

Every function parked in `src/non_matching/` falls into one of these. They are
listed here because the pattern is more useful than any single case, and
because knowing the class tells you whether a retry is worth it.

### 1. Halfword constant pooling

The most common blocker, and the one worth solving first.

    rom    ldr  r3, =0x400          word-sized pool load
    ours   ldrh r3, .L2 / .word 0x400

camelot-gcc's fingerprint list records that gcc-2.96 pools a small constant
**as a halfword when the target is an `unsigned short`**. The ROM's word-sized
load therefore means the original expression was not `unsigned short`-typed at
that point -- but no formulation found so far reaches that state. gcc narrows
based on the width of the eventual store, and it narrows through `s32` and
`u32` locals, through explicit casts, and through `~mask` constants that do not
fit in 16 bits.

Seen in `BreakItem`, `Func_80108c4`, `Func_8092b54`, and (narrowed to *byte*
width, same mechanism) `Func_800c548` / `Func_800c570`.

**Ruled out — do not repeat this experiment.** Reading the field into an
`s32` local before masking, rather than masking inline, *does* change what
gcc puts in the literal pool: inline gives `.word 1023` and a `mov`/`lsl`
pair for the other mask, while via a local gives `.word -1024` — the ROM's
constant. It changes nothing that matters. gcc still loads it with **`ldrh`**:

    rom    ldr  r3, =0xfffffc00
    ours   ldrh r2, .L6      with  .L6: .word -1024

Same constant in the pool, wrong instruction reading it. The pool content is
a red herring; the load width is the thing, and it follows the width of the
eventual store. Checking the pool and not the instruction is how this looked
solved for about ten minutes.

### 2. Register birth order

    rom    ldr r2, =0xd98 / add r1, r3, r2
    ours   ldr r1, =0xd98 / add r2, r3, r1

Every instruction is right; two registers are swapped throughout. gcc-2.96
allocates against `REG_ALLOC_ORDER {3, 2, 1, 0, ...}` in birth order, so
whichever pseudo is created first takes r3, then r2, then r1. One difference in
which subexpression is built first flips the whole function.

**This class is solvable.** `Func_808ed4c` was in it and came out: spelling the
scaled index as `(index << 3)` rather than `index * 8` changed the birth order.
Something equivalent probably exists for the others.

Seen in `Func_8015e8c`, `ModifyHP`, `ModifyPP`, `Func_800c548`.

### 3. Comparison canonicalisation

gcc rewrites `x >= C` as `x > C-1` and `x < C` as `x <= C-1`; the ROM keeps the
original constant. It also folds a run of equality tests into an unsigned range
check where the ROM tests each value separately.

Seen in `Func_80a3ce4` (`cmp #0xc1 / blt` vs `cmp #0xc0 / ble`) and
`Func_8078480` (2, 3, 4, 5 folded to `(kind - 2) <= 3`).

Unfolded compare chains *do* occur elsewhere in this ROM, so some C shape
reaches them.

### 4. Constant and address folding

gcc folds a symbol plus a constant offset into one pool entry (`=gState+586`)
where the ROM keeps two words and adds them at runtime; and gcc pools two
nearby offsets separately where the ROM derives the second from the first with
an `add`.

Seen in `Func_808d5a4` and `Func_8091254`. In the first case this probably
means the object being indexed is not the one currently named.

### 5. Scheduling

A load hoisted one or two instructions from where the ROM has it, with
everything else identical. Nothing tried so far moves it -- not a nested block,
not a named temporary, not reordering the statements.

Seen in `Func_809a44c` and in the original `rom_79338_c_a.s` attempt.

## On `decomp-permuter`

Classes 2 and 3 are exactly what `decomp-permuter` automates, and the
checkout is already in the tree. It is the obvious next lever, and it is worth
reaching for before hand-grinding any more of these.
