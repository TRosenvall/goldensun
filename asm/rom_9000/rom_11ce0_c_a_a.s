@ GetTerrainHeight
@ r0=layer selector, r1=world x (16.16), r2=world z (16.16). Returns the ground
@ height at that point as 16.16.
@ Selects the map layer from [iwram_1e70] + 0x130 + (r0 & 3) * 0x30, falling
@ back to ewram_10000 when no map is loaded. Tiles are 16 pixels and the grid is
@ 128 wide with a 4-byte record each; byte +3 of the record is the material id.
@ The material record at ewram_2c000 + id * 4 supplies the shape index in the
@ low nibble of its first byte, and its remaining bytes (ewram_2c001 + id * 4)
@ are the corner heights handed to the sampler along with (x & 15, z & 15).

@ exactly as Func_11f54 does but stops at the material byte, returning its low
@ nibble -- the shape/surface index -- without sampling a height.
