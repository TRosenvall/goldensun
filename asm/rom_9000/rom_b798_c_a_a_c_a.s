@ AddActorPart
@ r0=actor, r1=resource id. Finds the first empty entry in the actor's 4-slot
@ part array (+0x28..+0x34), allocates a part for the id with CreateSpriteLayer and
@ stores it there. Returns the new part, 0 if allocation failed, or -1 if all
@ four slots are already occupied. When this is the actor's first part, the
@ actor-level metrics (+0x20..+0x23, +0x18) are seeded from the resource header
@ exactly as InitSprite does. The part count at +0x27 grows only when the slot
@ filled was the one just past the end.
