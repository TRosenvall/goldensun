@ AddPaletteCycleChannel
@ r0=palette bank, r1=index within the bank, r2=frame delay, r3=colour count.
@ Returns 0 on success, or -1 when all four channels are already in use.
@ Resolves the target palette address as 0x5000000 + (bank * 16 + index) * 2,
@ stores it at +0x00 along with the delay at +0x08 and the count at +0x0A, and
@ DMAs the current colours from palette RAM into the channel's buffer at +0x0C
@ so the cycle rotates whatever is on screen at the time. Bumps the count at
@ +0xB0.
