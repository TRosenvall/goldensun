@ SelectPartyMember
@ r0 = which cursor, 0 or 1. Reads the selection byte at state+0x1C + r0 and
@ records the roster count at state+0x1E + r0. A selection of -1 resets to
@ member 0 without moving anything; otherwise the cursor glides to
@ (index * 24 - 10, 0x10) through Func_a1ac0 -- 24 pixels is the party-strip
@ pitch.
@
@ It then resolves that member with _Func_77394, compacts their inventory into
@ state+0x1C8 with Func_a3ddc, stores the count at state+0x218, and hands both
@ to Func_a35f8 to redraw. Finishes by rewinding the cursor sprite at
@ state+0x14 + r0*4, so the two cursors animate independently.
