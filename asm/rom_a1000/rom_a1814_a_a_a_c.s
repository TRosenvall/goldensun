@ SpawnPartyActors
@ r0 = window, r1 = x offset, r2 = y offset, r3 = spacing.
@ Creates one animated actor per party member and lays them out along the top
@ of the screen. For each roster id from _Func_796c4 it remaps the resource
@ through _Func_8b398 (which is what makes the sprites follow story progress),
@ creates the actor with _Func_bc70, and files it in three parallel arrays:
@
@     state+0x114 + i*4   the actor pointer
@     state+0x134 + i*2   its x, from the window's tile column * 8 plus
@                         i * (spacing + 0x10)
@     state+0x144 + i*2   its y, from the window's tile row * 8 plus 0x10
@
@ It then sets +0x40 to 0x10000 (unit scale), clears bits 0 and 2 of the
@ actor's +0x09, zeroes +0x26 and starts animation 1 with _Func_ba30. Slots
@ past the party size are zeroed out to 8. Finally it registers Func_a19a0 at
@ sort key 0xC80 so the actors get drawn every frame.
@
@ The roster count also goes to state+0x1E.
