@ SetActorPartsPalette
@ r0=entity, r1=palette index. Writes r1 to the palette field (+0x05) of every
@ part of the actor that has an animation table, then sets the dirty flag at
@ +0x25. The static counterpart to Func_92980, and what .gcc2_compiled. calls when
@ no cycling was requested. Ignores entities that are not draw kind 1.
