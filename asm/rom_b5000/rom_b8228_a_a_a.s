@ SetBattleAnimation
@ r0 = combatant id, r1 = animation index. Writes two words into the actor:
@ .Lc59a4[anim] to actor+0x34 and .Lc59c4[anim] to actor+0x30.
@ SKIPPED ENTIRELY when the character's class byte (record+0x128, the field
@ rom_77000's CanEquipItem uses) is 0x94 -- that class has no battle animations.
@ 46 external call sites; rom_c9000 calls it as _Func_b8228(id, anim) to put a
@ combatant into a reaction pose.
