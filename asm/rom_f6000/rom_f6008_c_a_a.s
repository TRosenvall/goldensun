@ ScalePalette
@ r0 = source colours, r1 = destination, r2 = a 16.16 scale, r3 = count.
@ Scales each 5:5:5 colour channel by channel: the three masks 0x001F, 0x03E0
@ and 0x7C00 are extracted, multiplied, shifted back down by 16 and re-masked, so
@ a channel that overflows is truncated to its own field rather than carrying
@ into the next. A brightness ramp, in other words.
@
@ Byte for byte the same routine as rom_f4000's Func_f4100; the two modules each
@ carry their own copy rather than sharing one.
