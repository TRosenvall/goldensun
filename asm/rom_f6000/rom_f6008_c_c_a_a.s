@ LinkDictionaryEntry
@ r0 = code. Splices entry `code` onto the front of its hash chain: the head
@ comes from the table at +0x3404, the entry's next and prev words are at
@ +code*12 and +code*12+4, and the old head's prev is fixed up when there was
@ one. A doubly-linked list, so Func_f7e34 can unlink in constant time.
